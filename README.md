# wd101

In this repo I try to build a simple registration form that I made as a part of a cohort at pupilfirst.org

## Funtionalities
1. Takes user inputs such as name, email, password, date of birth
2. It ensures that all the inputs are filled before the form is submitted
3. It checks for valid email addresses
4. It checks if the length of the password is atleast 6 or not
5. It checks that the age entired by the user is atleast 18 and atmost 57
6. It checks whether the user has accepted terms and conditions
7. It turns the border color green if the value in a input field is correct else turns red
8. Finally it stores the data submitted by the user in local storage and also displays them below the registration form
